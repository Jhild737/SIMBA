# SIMBA
Pascal based scripting language that uses color detection to automate mouse and keyboard movement. These were my first programming projects, most of them done in the summer before I started high school.  It was a custom Pascal based language designed to detect color values on the screen and move the mouse or press keys to automate tasks.
